Data Wrangling with MongoDB class code

This was my first real attempt at using ipython notebook as well as organizing code etc.  I made it a point during the class to be able to execute all the code in my own computing environment (fancy way of saying "on my laptop").  At the time I wasn't acquainted with version control or launching ipython servers from the command line.  It all resulted in a bit of a jumble.  The data files can be found at the UD032 (Udacity Data Wrangling with Mongo DB).  I may add them here at some point.
